# DelhiFund-Crowdfunding

 A crowdfunding smart contract for ETHGlobal New Delhi 2025.

 ## Overview
 DelhiFund is a decentralized crowdfunding platform where users contribute Ether to a campaign. Iâ€™m a beginner in Solidity, and I studied this contract to learn Ether handling and time-based logic, customizing the name and goal for my portfolio.

 ## Deployment
 - **Network**: Sepolia Testnet
 - **Contract Address**: https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0xa37d8bf74096f0129a88728ba6c41935e552327b

 ## Features
 - Goal: 1 ETH
 - Functions: Contribute, withdraw (owner), refund (if goal not met)
 - Time-based deadline

 ## Source
 Inspired by Solidity by Example (https://github.com/raineorshine/solidity-by-example).

 ## Learning Journey
 As an enthusiastic Web3 learner, I explored this contract to understand Ethereum transactions. I renamed it to DelhiFund, set a custom goal, and deployed it to Sepolia to gain practical experience for ETHGlobal.

 ## Usage
 1. Deploy with a duration (e.g., 7 days in seconds).
 2. Contribute Ether via MetaMask or Remix.
 3. Owner withdraws if goal is met; contributors claim refunds if not.
